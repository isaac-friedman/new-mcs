		Tuvia Yamnik was born in 1948 in the newly recognized State of Israel, where
		he grew up and served in the IDF. After moving to the United States in 1972
		he married his lifeâ€™s partner, Frieda Faena. In addition to his cantorial
		skills, Tuvia is passionate about creating a caring, committed community of
		Jews in midtown Manhattan. His welcoming personality and enthusiasm for all
		Jews makes him a natural for actively recruiting people to come inside the
		synagogue.He has devotedly and tirelessly worked to help the synagogue
		survive and he is enthusiastic about the revitalization currently taking
		place.
