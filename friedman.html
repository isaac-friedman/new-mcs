    Rabbi Yitzchak Friedman brings an abundance of unique skills to his job as
    assistant rabbi at MCS. Rabbi Friedman attended Brooklyn College where he
    earned a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a minor in Judaic Studies.
    Before college, he studied at Yeshiva Torah Vodaath and afterwards at Yeshivat
    Har Etzion (aka “Gush”) in Israel. Yitzchak enjoys a warm rapport with all
    the synagogue’s congregants who represent a wide spectrum of Jews working,
    living and visiting in midtown Manhattan. Rabbi Friedman combines
    scholarship, both secular and Jewish, with a deep idealistic commitment to
    helping Jews become more involved and connected with their Jewish heritage.
    In addition to his software engineering and Talmud skills, R’ Yitzchak is a
    sofer (Jewish scribe).
