	Rabbi Avrohom Dov Kahn has been teaching and inspiring Jews of all backgrounds
	for four decades. His love and caring for all Jews is well known. He studied
	under Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveichik for 6 Â½ years and received his Rabbinic
	Ordination (Yoreh Yoreh, Yodin Yodin) from Rabbi Moshe Feinstein in 1972.  He
	has a B.A. from CCNY and a M.B.A from NYU.
	In 1981, he founded the Center for Return in order to bring Jewish college
	students and young professionals closer to Judaism. Rabbi Kahn and Center for
	Return are responsible for over 500 Jews becoming completely Torah observant,
	including our President and several of our board members.  He is the author of
	numerous scholarly and popular articles on Torah topics and has published his
	own original commentary on the Passover Haggadah.

	Rabbi Kahn married his life partner Miriam in 1974 and they are the proud
	parents of six and grandparents of 20 and counting.
